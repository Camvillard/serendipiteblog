# Genesis Developer's Starter Child Theme

This is a very cool developer's child theme for the [Genesis theming framework](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/) which includes a modular architecture, Sass, gulp, Bourbon, Neat, and Composer.

It has been created with the help of the fabulous lab series teached by Tonya. You can find it here : https://knowthecode.io/series/lets-build-custom-developers-genesis-starter-child-theme
